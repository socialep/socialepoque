                <p>
                Welcome to CALCULAY!
                </p>
            <p>
            This document is related to the use of the Calculay application, providing described information below about its services. These terms are agreed upon when the user confirms an injustice cause.
            </p>
            <p>
            Calculay is a tecnological solution registered by Luzineide Carnaúba on Apple Store and Social Époque on Google Store. As such, these Terms of Use constitute an agreement between the user and those entities.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Calculay's Service
    </p>
    <p>
    We agree to provide the User with the Calculay Service. The Service includes all products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we provide to further our mission, which is: To provide a social alternative channel to report homophobia.  The Service consists of the following aspects (the Service):
</p>
<p>
CALCULATOR: Do you need to make an account and it is impossible to do it head on? Calculay also acts like a normal calculator, calculating addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponential, square root, percentage, sine, cosine and tangent, as well as other common operations of a scientific calculator.'
</p>
<p>
REPORTING CHANNEL: The user will be able to report at any time using our calculator. Just make an account of any expression, and instead of clicking the equal, press the equal button. The anonymous report will go to the map in the Mapping section.
</p>
<p>
The Data Policy
</p>
<p>
In order to provide our Service, you do not need to provide any personal data, only your location, which is unlikely to compromise very specific locations, since the location involves a 50m radius as an approximation.
</p>
<p>
Your Commitments
</p>
<p>
In exchange for our commitment to provide the Service, we require that such commitments below must be made by the user:
</p>
<p>
Who Is Allowed To Use Calculay: Anyone, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, sexual orientation and ethnicity, as long as they feel emotionally affected when witnessing a case of violence against the LGBTQ+ community.
</p>
<p>
How Calculay Is Not Allowed To Be Used: In order to be able to provide a secure and open Service to a wide community, it is necessary to establish some limits regarding the use of such application.
</p>
<p>
It is not allowed to abuse the power given by the Calculator to make anonymous reports to make it several times in a single place at intervals of twenty-four hours, under the risk of cancellation of excess requests.
</p>
<p>
It is not allowed to create a false anonymous report, at risk of annulment of requests.
</p>
<p>
Social Époque is not responsible for any legal proceedings following the anonymous complaint made by Calculay.
</p>
<p>
The Permissions You Give Us
</p>
<p>
Permission to upload and install possible updates to the Service on your device.
</p>
<p>
Sharing your location within a 50m radius
</p>
<p>
Use of complaint data for future research in favor of racial, feminist and LGBTQIA + causes.
</p>
<p>
Anulation of the Denouement
</p>
<p>
If the user makes a wrong report, he/she can send an email to socialepoquebr@gmail.com and request the deletion. Social Époque is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the request, and, consequently, the complaint. It is worth remembering that the user does not need to login. In other words, there is no creation or termination of an account in Calculay.
</p>
<p>
Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree
</p>
<p>
Our Agreement
</p>
<p>
If any aspect of this agreement is not feasible, the remaining aspects remain in effect.
</p>
<p>
Any change or waivers to our agreement must be made in writing and signed by us. The fact that we do not impose any aspect of this term does not constitute a waiver on our part.
</p>
<p>
Who Has Rights Under This Agreement
</p>
<p>
This agreement does not extend the right to third parties.
</p>
<p>
It is not allowed to transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
</p>
<p>
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to third parties. For example, this can occur if our ownership changes (eg, a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or if required by law.
</p>
<p>
Who's Responsible If Something Happens'
</p>
<p>
Our Service is provided “as it is" and we cannot guarantee that it will be safe and will always function in perfect condition. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
We also do not control the actions or statements of other persons, nor are we responsible for your (actions or conduct (online or offline) or content (including illegal or objectionable content). We are also not responsible for functionalities and services offered by other people or companies, even if they are accessed through our Service.
</p>
<p>
Our responsibility for everything that happens on the Service is limited as far as the law allows. If a problem occurs with our Service, it is not possible for us to know all possible impacts. By agreeing, the user agrees that we will not be liable ("responsible") for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising from or related to these Terms, even though we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, your information or your account.
</p>
<p>
How We Handle Litigation
</p>
<p>
If you are a consumer, the laws of your country of residence will apply to any claim, action or dispute you have against us that arises from or is related to these Terms ("claim"). Thus, you may be able to resolve your complaint in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the complaint. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively at the United States District Court of the Northern California District or a state court in County San Mateo, to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating the claim and that these Terms and any claim are governed by the laws of the State of California, regardless of the conflicting legal provisions.
</p>
<p>
Unsolicited Material
</p>
<p>
We always appreciate your views or other suggestions, but we may use them without restrictions or the obligation to compensate you for them, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
